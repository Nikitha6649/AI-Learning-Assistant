## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A deep teal (#307070) for a sense of intellectual depth, trust, and focus, promoting a conducive environment for learning. Inspired by the color of the deep ocean, teal invites exploration and discovery.
- Background color: A very light grey (#F0F2F2), almost white, providing a clean, non-distracting backdrop that enhances readability and reduces eye strain during prolonged use.
- Accent color: A muted olive green (#708030), which harmonizes with the teal to evoke growth, knowledge, and nature. The accent is desaturated and darkened to ensure contrast without overwhelming the user, subtly highlighting important interactive elements.
- Clean and modern font for headings and body text, ensuring excellent readability.
- Consistent use of clear, minimalist icons throughout the interface.
- Clean, intuitive layout with clear visual hierarchy.
